Assumptions:
1) I interpret this problem as the need to determine a vertex coordinate system that can be used to identify a right triangle by it's row/column. 
2) I do not see an issue with multiple combinations of vertex coordinates mapping to the same row/column as long as they all also map to the same pixel coordinates.

Description of Solution:
Since assigning a coordinate system to the image made up of right triangles is essentially an arbitrary choice, I structured my coordinate system by fitting it to the mystery triangle on the second page's requirements. This triangle required that both 1 and 2 must be in the same column on the x axis. This triangle also required that both 1 and 3 must be in the same row on the y axis. In this way, I came up with the following coordinate system where each axis label below is spaced out by 10 pixels:

10/12

9/11

6/8

5/7

2/4

1/3

0	1/2	3/4	5/6	7/8	9/10	11/12	

Using this coordinate system, the mystery triangle with coordinates (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3,3) corresponds to row/column E3. 

Also in this GitHub repository is a Visual Studio C# project representing this coding question. The user can search the image for a right triangle either by pixel coordinates or vertex coordinates. Note: I would typically comment my code and, in general, make things much more robust.
